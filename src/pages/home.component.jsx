              At Dorfville Farms, we have adopted a Farm2Fork strategy that
              ensures we produce high quality and healthy agricultural foods and
              produce straight to our customers kitchens with little to no
              impact on our environment. We have adopted a zero-waste practice
              by continuously implementing a sustainable food production system
              to ensure that we make use of renewable energy in all our farm
              operations as much as possible and ensuring that all wastes
              generated at the farm are recycled and reused on the farm.
